  abstract  = {Stars with changing magnitudes are called variables (Fig. 14.1). Variations in the brightness of stars were first noted in Europe at the end of the 16th century, when Tycho Brake's supernova lit up (1572) and the regular light variation of the star o Ceti (Mira) was observed (1596). The number of known variables has grown steadily as observational precision has improved (Fig. 14.2). The most recent catalogues contain about 30000 stars known or suspected to be variable.},

Intrinsic variable stars will change in size, shape or temperature over time, or they may experience changes in light due to physical processes around the star such as shells or disks. Others undergo eclipses by binary partners. There are a huge variety of such stars, and not all of them are going to be easy targets for amateurs.},

In our modern era it seems incredible to think that the telescope was invented only 400 years ago and the quality of astronomical telescopes has steadily improved ever since. Therefore, let us now turn to an examination of the kinds of instruments and auxiliary equipment available to sky watchers. I shall cover binoculars in the chapter about observing binocular variables.},
